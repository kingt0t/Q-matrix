A new version has been made available and should soon
be on F-Droid, Google Play and TestFlight!

Expect the new version to be on most platforms in 2 days.

It's not the biggest release, but a release nonetheless.

### Changes
- Separate public and personal chats
- Use a bullhorn icon for public chats without an avatar
- Fix sync being started multiple times on startup
- Fix the `room.member_count` error (might require clearing of data)
- Many SDK changes, for features in future releases
