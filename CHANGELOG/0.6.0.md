A new version has been pushed to F-droid!

- Add ability to create group chats!
- Show chat creation events ('Wilko has created this group')!
- Show emote messages correctly!
- Handle display name changes!
  Display names of messages will now be as they
  were at time of sending.
- Don't show invite and join events in direct chats
  This is only happens for the two initial users in the direct
  chat. If someone invites someone else to the direct chat
  (trough another client), the invitation will show up
  in the timeline.
- Use the `timeout` parameter while syncing.
  This means that receiving new messages should be
  way quicker! (Thanks Mathieu!)
- Store messages retrieved remotely (thanks Mathieu!)
  This means that scrolling up in a chat will be faster
  now, because the messages are cached.
- Always show a date header above the oldest event
- Show replies correctly in chat overview
- Show sent state icon next to own message in chat overview
- Show newly joined rooms at the top in the chat overview
- Use a bit bolder font for chat names in overview
