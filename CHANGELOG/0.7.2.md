A new version has been pushed to F-droid!

This release is mostly focused on bug fixing and
bug reporting! This is why I urge **all users
who have been having problems before to try
Patle again!** Chances are that your problem has been
fixed, and if not, it will be reported with more information
so I can fix it!

When an error is reported, this data is sent:
- Operating system version
- Device model, brand, manufacturer and whether it's a simulator
- A unique ID based on your device

In some errors the homeserver domain is logged, I will try to prevent
this in the future.

This release also includes preperation for an iOS release
next week!

Fixes and other changes:
- Handle rooms that the user has left (a notice is shown
  that you can't send any messages)
- Show a date header above the chat creation event (not the
  first known event in the list as before)
- When an error occurs during sync, show a message, including
  the Exception name
- Fix replies causing an error if the `formattedBody` does
  not adhere to the spec (thanks to Mathieu!)
- Fix errors not showing when logging in
- Fix loading spinner showing when checking username or logging in
  even if loading took less than 3 seconds
- Fix direct chats not detected when adder after the initial sync
- Some general syncing issues have been fixed (causing the dreaded
  infinite loading spinner).
