A new version has been made available and should soon
be on Google Play!

Note that this version will not be on TestFlight (yet) because
notifications are currently only implemented on Android
(using Firebase, so same goes for F-Droid for the time being).

### Changes
- Show notifications when receiving a new message!
- Username is not checked whether it's available anymore

  This was done for a future feature (registration), however, a
  different approach will probably be taken.
