A new version is available on F-droid!

Changes include:

- Implement direct chats correctly!
    - Use user user avatar as chat avatar if direct
    - Hide user name in direct chat
- Use names of room members if no room name is set
  (whether the chat is direct or not)
- Add border to left of replied-to messages to easily
  differentiate them
- Show redaction events!
- Use icons instead of letters if chat has no avatar
    - Use different icons for direct chats than group chats
      (and in the future public chats)
- Use user color for direct chats if the user has no avatar
- Simplify member change messages ('Pat has joined' -> 'Pat joined', etc)
- Tweak font sizes (thanks to [Mathieu Velten](https://matrix.to/#/@mat:tout.im))!
- Change date header style (smaller and full caps)
