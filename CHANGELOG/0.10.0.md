A new version has been pushed to F-droid and TestFlight!

### Changes
- Improve scrolling through chat messages!
  
  Messages are now paginated under the hood, before the whole
  message list was rebuild when loading more messages, causing a jittery
  scrolling experience.

- Support typing notifications!

  Typing notifications are shown and send while typing.
  
- Add chat settings screen

  Currently you can see the chat name, avatar, description and
  members. More will be added in the future.
  
  You can go to the chat settings screen by clicking on the title
  of the chat. This'll probably change in the future (at least to
  be easier).

- Reverse swipe direction of images (thanks Nathan!)
- Fix ripple not showing on send button
- Make UI refreshing more efficient
- The App Store (iOS) name is now 'Pattle' instead of 'Pattle IM'

  When a chat is open, the UI will only be rebuild if *that* chat
  has updates.

- Lot's of code clean ups and improvements, mostly in the SDK

### What to expect in the next release

- A release on Google Play!
- A release on the official F-droid repo!
- Remove Cupertino specific styling on iOS
  
    Will now use Material Design, but altered for iOS. Having
    the discrepancy between Cupertino and Material was also the reason
    why some things didn't show up in iOS or why some things would be blue
    instead of the Pattle red.
- Notifications!? (F-droid)
