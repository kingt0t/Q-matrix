A new version has been made available and will become
available on Google Play and TestFlight!

Because of corona this might take longer than usual.

### Changes
- Huge performance improvements! All SDK processing now happens in a different isolate (comparable to a thread)!
- Also huge start up time improvement! When opening the app you should see your chats in
  *less than or equal to a second*! (will vary per device)
- You'll now see two checkmarks when a message is read!
- Add Dutch translations! (thanks to Louis Matthijssen!)
- You can logout now!
- An error along with a strack trace is now shown when the initial sync fails.
  You can use it to inform me and make an issue!
- For the launcher icons vectors are now used on Android when it's supported
- Contributing is now easier, you don't have to sign a CLA anymore!
